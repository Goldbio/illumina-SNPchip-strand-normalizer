# illumina SNP chip strand normalizer 

illumina's SNP chip produces both + and - stranded genotypes. 
For further analysis, this mixed stranded genotypes should be
normalized. 

This module transformes all - stranded genotypes into + stranded genotypes
based on each illumina SNP chip's manifest file.
